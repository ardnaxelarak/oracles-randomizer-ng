Changelog for Oracles-Randomizer-NG

================================================================================
Testing branch
================================================================================

Bugfixes:
- Pol's Voices are now killed when flute or harp tunes are truncated
- Selecting "warp to start" option in rando menu no longer saves the game
- Ages: Rod of Seasons displays its name correctly in Wild Tokay minigame
- Ages: Fixed being able to enter jabu-jabu's belly without mermaid suit when
  there are two entrances to the dungeon
- Ages: Fixed a bug where sometimes the cart would not progress in the target
  carts minigame

Logic changes (Ages):
- Defeating Shadow Hag with ember seed satchel is now in hard logic instead of
  normal.
- As the "first goron dance" prize can be obtained in either the present or the
  past, logic has been updated to reflect this. The second dance, with the
  Letter of Recommendation, can only be done in the past (after finishing the
  1st dance in either the present or the past).

Other changes (general):
- "Warp to start" option now warps to the starting tree (instead of the game's
  initial spawn location) due to popular demand.

Other changes (Ages):
- Sped up timewarps by removing a half-second delay upon arrival
- The shooting gallery now tells you what item you'll get before playing.
- You no longer get a sword in the shooting gallery, or a seed shooter in target
  carts, if you don't already have the corresponding item. Logic for target
  carts has been updated to reflect this.
  - For target carts, if you don't have the seed shooter, the slingshot may be
    equipped instead. Completing the game with the hyper slingshot is in normal
    logic. (It is impossible with the L-1 slingshot.)
  - Any seed type works, EXCEPT gale seeds with the seed shooter. The cooldown
    is too high, and while it's technically possible to complete the minigame
    with shooter + gale seeds, it's not in logic. Hyper slingshot + gale seeds
    are in logic, as are all other combinations. When you play the minigame, the
    first seed type you own from the following list is equipped: scent, ember,
    pegasus, mystery, gale. You are given 99 of that seed type for the duration
    of the game.
- Water tile in d6 past entrance has been changed to be shallow, like in
  jangler's randomizer, to prevent softlocks.
- The left side of the bridge leading to Symmetry City no longer exists before
  it's supposed to. (Prevents softlocks if you try to cross from the opposite
  side before building the bridge.)

================================================================================
Alpha 3 (2023-01-19)
================================================================================

Features:
- Ages support complete with cross-items and keysanity!
- NEW MENU accessible by pressing the select button twice quickly while in-game.
  Contains two submenus: "Dungeon Items" (view keys/maps/compasses for all
  dungeons), and "Warp To Start" (replaces treewarp, always on).
- Auto Mermaid Suit: Hold the direction button to keep moving in a direction
  (optional)

Bugfixes:
- Seasons: Fixed seed shooter graphic being corrupted in shops & some other
  places

Ages logic changes (non-crossitems related):
- Use the long hook to cross from rolling ridge base present to the upper area
  near d5 (crossing through d2 skip room). Hard logic only as the bushes you
  must use are not visible on-screen. (Not sure if this scenario can come up in
  the first place.)
- Fixed "rolling ridge past old man" node to be based on "ridge base past east"
  instead of "ridge base past west".
- D3: Various new logical rules involving not having bombs (only possible with
  keysanity).
- D4: Logic changes to account for cape jumping across lava to reach the vanilla
  switch hook chest. Affects key logic in particular, even if you don't have
  the cape, due to softlock potential. (Much of D4 could be inaccessible!)
- D4 minecart room with stalfos: Using the seed satchel to kill the stalfos
  through the wall is no longer in logic, even hard logic. (Using
  sword/rod/fool's ore remains in normal logic, though.)
- D6 present: The water leading to the orb room full of pits is considered
  passable with only pegasus seeds + feather (bomb jump not needed). In hard
  logic, it's considered passible with only the feather, no pegasus seeds.
- D6 present: Changes to the orb/hole room logic. Jumping into a hole to use
  a seed on the orb is now hard logic. Some other changes that mostly only
  affect hard logic.
- D8: Using switch hook, rod, boomerang, or ranged pegasus seeds to combat the
  floormasters to get the first chest is now in logic.

Other changes:
- You can talk to King Zora immediately after getting his item to get permission
  to enter Jabu, as long as the seas have been cleaned, without needing to exit
  and re-enter the room.
- Attempting to enter Jabu-Jabu's Belly without the mermaid suit causes Link to
  drown. This may look a bit funny if Jabu-Jabu's belly is randomized to be
  somewhere entirely different. Don't panic, it's not a bug! (However it is
  still possible to enter the D8 underwater section without the mermaid suit,
  for now.)
- As in Jangler's randomizer, there are 9 dungeon entrances and 8 dungeons, due
  to present D2 being used as an alternate entrance. However, when dungeons are
  shuffled, one dungeon is now randomly selected to have a second entrance,
  instead of it always being D2.
- Red soldier who wants mystery seeds has been moved to be closer to his
  original vanilla location.
- Harp and flute animations can be skipped by pressing A+B.
- A number of softlock prevention-related changes have been reverted due to the
  always-on "warp to start" feature:
  - The timeportal in crescent island present west now responds to the tune of
	echoes again as normal.
  - Seasons softlock prevention features are still in place until I get around
	to removing them and updating the logic.

================================================================================
Alpha 2 (2021-12-21)
================================================================================

Bugfixes:
- Fixed room layout changes not always being applied (goron mountain water room,
  spool swamp portal).
- Fixed non-crossitems logic being totally messed up by thinking that you have
  all of the ages items immediately.

Logic:
- OW: Using the switch hook to cross goron mountain is now in hard logic (even
  with long hook, because you can't see the bushes from the top side).
- D3: Using switch hook or long hook to reach D3 miniboss is in hard logic
  (because you can't see the pots). Also, it is actually impossible to use the
  switch hook without pegasus seeds to reach the pots. Updated logic to reflect
  this.
- D6: Removed seed shooter logic for hitting the orb without the magic boomerang
  to reach the miniboss. It's too much even for hard logic.
- D7: Fixed a loophole causing jumping on button edges without hitting the
  buttons to be in normal logic.

================================================================================
Alpha 1 (2021-01-28)
================================================================================

- Initial release based on original randomizer; seasons only.
